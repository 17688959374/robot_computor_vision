This pkg include two python files and a floder including test pictures.
camera_test is especially for the real-sense camera.Before using this code you need connect the camera first. When running the code, you can see a windows that shows the vedio of the camera, then press q to shot. 
cv_test have many functions: 
1. Dirty spot detect: code will highlight the edge of the yellow dirty point or the transparent dirty spot under purple light then return the area of whole spots and the suggested posture for the end effector.
2. Compute real coordinate: code can compute the real physical coordinate under camera frame. By using this and the coordinate of camera under robot base frame we can get the 3d coordinates of these dirty points in real physical world.
In the screen_shot folder I left some resault pics for checking.
